## A minimalist config for your github

1. No disctractions
2. Better performance
3. more practicality
4. Minimalist look

## How to configure your visual studio code:

### Extensions

**First of call install these extensions bellow:**

- Min Theme: **https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme**
- Symbols: **https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.symbols**
- Apc Customize UI++: **https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension**

You can costumize the first two extensions as your preference. Or just leave them as I configured them myself (The extension configuration is already included in the settings).

### Font family

As you can see I'm using a different font in my visual studio code. To use it you need to have it installed on your computer. Here is the download link: **https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/lp/mono/**

Or you can use another font of your choice, and to import it, just go to the settings and change the ("editor.fontFamily" attribute: "JetBrains Mono"), and enter the font you want!

### Visual Studio Code Settings 

Now open your vscode and use this shortcut: ``ctrl + shift + p``. 
And then type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)" and open:

![settings](https://github.com/Nevesto/vscode-visual-configs/assets/87545167/01484940-8c3a-4a0d-b5c2-1fa2eed09410)

This took you to the github settings file, so copy the entire contents of the "settings.json" file, and paste it there!

Then reload your vscode and finish, you have a **minimalist visual studio code**!

If you want, you can customize it even more, just search and configure it to your style.

## Usage help

As you can see, we've hidden many of the visual studio code interfaces, so I'll give you a little help on shortcuts that might be useful in your daily life.

This shortcut opens the command palette:

    ctrl + shift + p 

This shortcut opens the github tools interface such as extensions, open terminals and others:

    ctrl + q

To open the terminal use:

    ctrl + '

And now you can start enjoying your new minimalist and practical visual studio code. For any questions you can open a new issue, and I will try to answer you as clearly and quickly as possible!
